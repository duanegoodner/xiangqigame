## Brief Project History
* Began as an assignment for Oregon State undergraduae course CS 162 in 2020 (at that time, it was just an implementation of piece moves in Python)
* As my programming skills have improved over time, I have used this project as a benchmark, occasionally re-implementing / enhancing it.
